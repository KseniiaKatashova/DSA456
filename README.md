DSA456 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Content of teh course:

This is a survey course on algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer programs.
Students taking this course will learn how these classical data structures and algorithms operate.
Students will learn the theoretical basis for the performance of these algorithms and data structures. 
They will learn how to implement these data structures and algorithms and apply them to real programming problems.
Students will also learn how these data structures are used to implement parts of the standard language libraries.
Furthermore, the course will also introduce students to computational theory and provide a fundamental background to computer science concepts.
